GLY6932 Machine Learning: Repository for the research project. 
The repository contains a Python script that can be used to plot the distribution of xenolith datasets on a global map.
Additionally, the script can generate correlation and covariance maps, perform principal component analysis (PCA), and create K-nearest neighbors (KNN) clusters.
